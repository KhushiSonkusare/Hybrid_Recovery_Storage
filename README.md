# Hybrid Recovery Storage

## Project Overview
This project implements an **Adaptive & Dynamic Hybrid Storage Approach** using ML-based workload prediction. It dynamically switches between **replication** and **erasure coding** based on real-time workload patterns.

## Progress
âœ… **Data Preprocessing Completed**  
- Cleaned and prepared dataset for ML-based workload prediction.  
- Extracted features for access patterns and storage optimization.

## Next Steps
- Implement ML model for workload prediction.  
- Develop a decision-making system to switch between replication and erasure coding.
